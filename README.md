# Github API React App

## Description

This is an app built with React that serves the purpose of fetching data from Github API. I made use of React Context API to avoid having to pass props through multiple component hierarchies. I also used a Redux-style reducer to manage actions and state changes in the context module. Twitter Bootstrap is used for styling the app, together with custom CSS.
